- Public Cloud:
Offered by third-party providers over the internet.
Resources are shared among multiple customers (multi-tenancy).
Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.

- Private Cloud:
Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization.
Can be on-premises or hosted by a third-party provider.
Provides greater control and security.

# Cloud Service Models:

```
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
Allows users to rent virtual machines, storage, and networks.

- PaaS (Platform as a Service):
Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.
Simplifies application deployment without managing the underlying infrastructure.
Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

- SaaS (Software as a Service):
